# XVIZ Primitive Specification

Primitives are the most basic units of rendering data. The geometry primitives currently supported
in XVIZ are:

- `point`
- `polygon`
- `polyline`
- `circle`
- `stadium`
- `text`
- `image`

## Base Field

Every primitive in XVIZ has an optional base object which contains fields that are common to all
objects. These fields let you associated data with an object or applying styling to the object.

Fields of the base object:

| Name            | Type                  | Description                                    |
| --------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `object_id`     | `optional<object_id>` | Which object is this primitive associated with |
| `inline_style`  | `optional<style>`     | Optional inline style                          |
| `style_classes` | `list<class_id>`      | Semantic/visualize classes.                    |

## Styling

A major use of the base object is to style a primitive. As an example in JSON of a `point` primitive
using style classes:

```js
{
    "base": {
      "object_id": "178beda89169420cbb876c14acdba7f8",
      "classes": ["car", "important"]
    },
    "vertices": [[9, 15, 3], [20, 13, 3], [20, 5, 3]]
}
```

You can do the same with inline styles but it is much less efficient to send the same styling
information for each object over and over. Here is what it looks like to use an inline style form:

```js
{
    "base": {
      "object_id": "178beda89169420cbb876c14acdba7f8",
      "style": {
          "fill_color": "#FF0000",
          "stroke_color": "#000080"
      }
    },
    "vertices": [[9, 15, 3], [20, 13, 3], [20, 5, 3]]
}
```

## Point Primitive

The point primitive is the most basic XVIZ drawable. It can represent either a single point or a
point cloud. If there is more than one vertex in the vertices field then it is a point cloud.

| Name   | Type                  | Description                                                                                                                   |
| ------ | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| points | list<Point3d>         | If more than one point is in the list then this is a point cloud, otherwise it is just a single point. (Optionally flattened) |
| colors | optional<list<color>> | If present this provides a color for every point in the `points` list, and overrides any inline or class color styling.       |

Example:

```js
{
    "points": [[9, 15, 3], [20, 13, 3], [20, 5, 3]]
}
```

## Polygon Primitive

The polygon primitive is used to draw any closed shape.

| Name     | Type          | Description                                                                         |
| -------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| vertices | list<Point3d> | The vertices of the polygon. Minimum of 3 vertices required. (Optionally flattened) |

JSON example using style class for styling:

```js
{
    "vertices": [[9, 15, 3], [20, 13, 3], [20, 5, 3]]
}
```

## PolyLine Primitive

The polyline primitive is used to draw any polygonal chain.

| Name     | Type          | Description                                                                          |
| -------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| vertices | list<Point3d> | The vertices of the polyline. Minimum of 2 vertices required. (Optionally flattened) |

JSON example using style class for styling:

```js
{
    "vertices": [[9, 15, 3], [20, 13, 3], [20, 5, 3]]
}
```

## Circle Primitive

The circle primitive is used to draw circles and rings, itâ€™s center lines up with the object center.

| Name     | Type    | Description                                           |
| -------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| center   | point3d | Continuous space position of the center of the circle |
| radius_m | float32 | The radius of the circle in meters                    |

Example:

```js
{
    "center": [9, 15, 3],
    "radius_m": 2.5
}
```

## Stadium Primitive

The stadium primitive is used to draw 2D geometric stadiums. As of XVIZ v2.0.0, stadiums are the
closest that XVIZ has to support for 3D capsule shapes.

| Name     | Type    | Description                                                                                                       |
| -------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| start    | point3d | The midpoint of one end of the rectangle portion of a stadium that is adjacent to a semi-circle.                  |
| end      | point3d | The midpoint of the other end of the rectangle portion of the stadium which is adjacent to the other semi-circle. |
| radius_m | float32 | The radius of the circles in meters                                                                               |

Example:

```js
{
    "start": [9, 15, 3],
    "end": [20, 13, 3],
    "radius_m": 2.5
}
```

## Text Primitive

The text primitive is used to render any kind of purely textual information. Its position refers to
the top left corner of the text.

| Name     | Type    | Description                |
| -------- | ------- | -------------------------- |
| position | point3d | Continuous space           |
| text     | string  | The actual text to display |

Example:

```js
{
    "position": [9, 15, 3],
    "text": "Location of interest"
}
```

## Image Primitive

The image primitive is used to render existing graphics.

| Name      | Type        | Description                                      |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| position  | point3d     | The position of the top left corner of the image |
| data      | byte_buffer | Packed RGB camera image data                     |
| width_px  | float32     | Width of the source image in pixels              |
| height_px | float32     | Height of the source image in pixels             |

This is a pure JSON example, for efficiency reasons you would normally use the binary protocol which
stores the raw image directly instead of needing to base64 encode it.

```js
{
    "position": [9, 15, 3],
    "data": "/9j/2wBDAAMCAgICAgMCAgIDAwMDBAYEBAQEBAgGBgUGCQgKCgkICQkKDA8MCgsOCwkJDRENDg8QEBEQCgwSExIQEw8QEBD/yQALCAABAAEBAREA/8wABgAQEAX/2gAIAQEAAD8A0s8g/9k=",
    "width_px": 1280,
    "height_px": 720
}
```

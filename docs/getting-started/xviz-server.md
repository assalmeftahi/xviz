# XVIZ Server

# Overview

This simple XVIZ Server will read XVIZ data files defined [XVIZ Data formats](TODO) and server them
over a web socket.

This server supports the basic [XVIZ Session](TODO) to load XVIZ data generated from the
[XVIZBuilders](TODO).

# Not production ready

This server is currently for demonstration purposes.

A more capable server is planned in our [roadmap]. In the meantime, the [XVIZ Session](TODO)
definition can be used to create a tailored XVIZ server to fit your needs.

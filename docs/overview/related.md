XVIZ targets a problem space of visualizing temporal geospatial and metric data related to
autonomous systems. The focus is on a semantic view of a system that aims to be decoupled from the
underlying platform.

There are related projects that share some similarities with XVIZ, but often target a more general
problem space or are coupled to a specific platform. It is valuable to keep track of these efforts
as well as the evolution of these projects to learn from and help chart the path for XVIZ as it
evolves.
